# Multi-Modal-Vision-Language-Model-for-Cancer-Diagnosis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and experiments for a project combining medical imaging and clinical text (clinical reports). The focus is on exploring single- and cross-modal models (vision and clinical-language models, plus cross-modal experiments) for tumor-related tasks.
